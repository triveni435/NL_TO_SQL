# NL_TO_SQL
Developed an NLP-based application that converts natural language questions into SQL queries automatically. The 
system allows users to type simple English questions (e.g., “Show all employees with salary greater than 50,000”) and 
then converts them into correct SQL commands to fetch data from the database. Used NLP techniques, text 
preprocessing, and a trained model to understand user input and generate accurate SQL queries. Designed a Flask web 
interface for user interaction and integrated with a database for real-time query execution.
